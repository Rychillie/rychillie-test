After a while working with NextJS and studying it I found a way to implement `Imports` in a more dynamic way, leaving the code cleaner.

One thing that bothered me a lot was the fact that I had to write a tripe of imports like: `import * from "../../../../what-want-import"`, in some cases my code was stuck extremely large for something that wasn't needed.

So one fine day in October I was browsing `NextJS Issues` and came across this new [Pull Request](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/11293) that comes with the proposal to add support for `Paths` in `tsconfig.json` and `jsconfig.json` by default.

The cool thing is that with this possibility I could solve my problem that had been afflicting me for a long time. Implemented from version 9.4 of NextJS I would simply need to define a `baseURL` in my config file to support absolute imports.

```json
// tsconfig.json or jsconfig.json file

{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseURL": "."
  }
}

// Will result in: import Button from 'components/button'
```

Also I can use a custom prefix, just add a `paths` in the configuration:

```json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "baseURL": ".",
    "paths": {
      "@components/*": ["components/*"]
    }
  }
}

// It will result in: import Button from '@components/button'
```

Remember that code editors like VSCode have automatic support for their settings in `jsconfig.json` so just click Command+Click to go straight to the file that was defined there and edit it smoothly. And it's worth noting that [Atom and IntelliJ](https://github.com/tleunen/babel-plugin-module-resolver#editors-autocompletion) also support edits.

I would like to leave as a reference an article by [Paco](https://paco.me/writing/better-nextjs-imports) that inspired me to write this article and share it in a simple way.
