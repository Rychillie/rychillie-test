For the last few months I have been working with SCSS on different types of projects, and as I have become more and more interested in NextJS, I would like to integrate with it. That's why I come through this super simple mini-tutorial to explain how I perform such activity.

With our project already started, let's start installing some packages, in this example I'll be using the `yarn` as my _Package Manager_, however, feel free to use it with `npm` if you prefer.

To get started let's install the Sass package using one of these two commands:

```bash
yarn add sass
or
yarn add node-sass
```

Right after we will install the Next Plugin. For those unfamiliar with Next Plugins, they basically add functionality without the need for extra configuration.

To install the SASS/SCSS Plugin created by the Next team, we will use the following command in the project terminal:

```bash
yarn add @zeit/next-sass
```

Now let's define the SASS/SCSS default in our project, making some changes in the `next.config.js`, file, if your project doesn't have this file, just create it with this same name. So let's put the following configuration in this file:

```js
const path = require("path");
const withSass = require("@zeit/next-sass");

module.exports = withSass({
  cssModules: true,
});

module.exports = {
  /* Add your SCSS file folder path Here! */
  sassOptions: {
    includePaths: [path.join(__dirname, "styles")],
  },
};
```

Now you can start creating and using SCSS/SASS files that work perfectly.

Remember to always import your files with the `.scss` extension instead of `.css`.
